Hi, Sharing with my friends my yucky work on advent of code 2023 https://adventofcode.com/2023

You can look at it, but this code is absolutely not fit for any purposes other than entertainment.  I plan to delete or make private hide this repo after a while because this isn't intended to be anything I want on a resume.

As you should be aware, advent of code is a daily bit of coding, for fun, entertainment, and a little bit of competition for those who want.

So if you've found this, enjoy it while it lasts, laugh at my foibles, and doom be upon thee who pronounces judgement beyond "hahaha" or "eek!"
